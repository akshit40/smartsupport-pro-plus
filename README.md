# SmartSupport PRO+ — Enterprise Capstone Project (Demo)

This is a competition-ready project bundle for the Kaggle Agents Intensive Capstone.
It contains a local, runnable demo (no API keys required) that illustrates a multi-agent
customer support workflow with triage, knowledge retrieval, drafting, quality checks,
sentiment detection, escalation, follow-ups, memory, and observability.

See `notebook.ipynb` for a runnable Kaggle-friendly demo and `src/` for the source code.
